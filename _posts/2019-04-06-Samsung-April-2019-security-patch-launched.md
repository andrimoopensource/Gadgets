Samsung has just released details for its April 2019 security patch. The company continuously releases monthly security patches for numerous of its devices in order to patch vulnerabilities which arise in the Android operating system. The April 2019 security patch will make its way to Samsung’s smartphones in the next couple of days.

This security patch is geared to not only fix various bugs but also five major vulnerabilities including the one which allows a remote attacker to run an arbitrary code on the victim’s device using a specially crafted file. The patch which will come in the form of an over-the-air software update consists of fixes for 15 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items. One of these vulnerabilities would allow a remote hacker to disable protected features on the victim’s device through emergency mode.

While Samsung isn’t the fastest when it comes to releasing the latest versions of Android as software updates, it barely ever lags behind when it comes to security patches. In all likelihood, Samsung’s 2019 flagship devices will be the first ones to receive the April 2019 security patch update.
