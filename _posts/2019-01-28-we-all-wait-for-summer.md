There could also be alittle suggestion that Microsoft is not any longer supporting Windows Mobile.

The suspicion arises from Microsoft terminating another app on the platform.

In Gregorian calendar month last year Microsoft terminated support for Windows Phone 7.1, 8 and Windows 8, and these days in a very post on user voice “Windows Phone 10” joined the list.

Microsoft writes:

Microsoft Translator app on the Windows Phone 10 won't be out there within the Microsoft Store beginning in Gregorian calendar month 2019.

If you presently use the Windows Phone 10 app, text translation can still work, however speech translation won't be out there beginning on October fifteen, 2019.

Microsoft notes that they'll still support and improve the Windows ten app, and suggests users strive the app on iOS or humanoid, that conjointly offers extra languages and options.

One would have thought no-one is victimization these apps on Windows Mobile any longer, however from reviews within the Store this doesn't seem to be the case.


Hopefully, the user WHO known as it a “must have app” can meet it on another platform.
